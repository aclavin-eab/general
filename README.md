Some various straight forward and simple functions I like to use

fancynext
=========

Sort of a revolving next function. If you have a list that you are using the next function on (or any several sibling 
element for that matter) this function allows you to next from the last sibling back to the first

Easy to use like any other plugin by putting the following in head, but it is so simple and short might be better to just 
copy paste. 

    <script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery.fancynext.js"></script>
    
Either way, the function should be used as follows 
    
    $('selector').fancyNext();
